        <p>Computer Aided Design was the second module taught to us in Fab lab. CAD simply means the use of computer based softwares to aid in the creation , modification or analysis of a design. We were taught about two softwares namely Fusion 360 and Auto CAD. Fusion 360 is a cloud based 3D modelling , CAD,CAm.and PCB software platform. Auto CAD is a commercial software that is used to draw and draft 2D and #d designs. We learned about various commands of both the softwares and created some awesome 3D models.</p>
        <p>Learning Outcomes: <br>1) To undertand the various tools used in CAD softwares <br> 2) To be able to make 2D and 3d models using CAD softwares. </p>
