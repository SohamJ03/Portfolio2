        <p>My journey of Fab Lab started with Web Development. It was the very first module taught to me in Fab Lab. My mentors first gave us introduction to Web Development , what language do we require to creat a website. First they taught us about HTML which is a markup language which is used to design the skeleton of a website. We learned about a lot of tags and there uses in HTML. After that we learned about CSS which is a styling language used to style our websites. Lastly we were taught about Java Script , which helps in building logic of website . With the knowledge gained in this module we were asked to make a Portfolio website.</p>
        <p>Learning Outcomes:<br> 1)To know how websites are made <br> 2)To be able to make a website on our own </p>
