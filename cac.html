    <div class="report">
        <p>Computer Aided Cutting was the third module taught to us in Fab lab. This included cutting a parametric design on a cardboard using Laser Cutter machine. <br> Laser Cutter: <br> Name : SIL Laser Engraving - Cutting Machine <br> SIL laser engraving machine is versatile & finds application in signage, indoor & outdoor advertisement, art & craft, gift, shoes, toys, garments, model cutting, papers & packaging, wood & MDF cutting industry, interior, decorators and many more. SIL built laser engraver which is engineered & manufactured in india. <br> </p>
        <p>
            Features:
            <ul>
                <li>High cutting precision and positional accuracy</li>
                <li>Improved edge quality and surface finish</li>
                <li>Higher repeatability</li>
                <li>Advanced laser tools for material processing applications</li>
                <li>Drilling and engraving in addition to cutting</li>
                <li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
                <li>Shapes High Speed belt drive plotting unit with precise micro stepping drives</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            Laser CAD software: <br>
            LaserCAD is a cost-effective laser motion control software running under Windows which is user-friendly. Graphic format like AI, PLT, DXF, NC and the graphic made byCorelDraw, Auto CAD and Mastcam and is also supported in LaserCAD. This software can be used to perfrom basic editing functions on then dxf file , like changing dimensions , seleting the lines that are supposed to be cut by laser cutter and also specifying some parameters like power and speed. I used this software to export the design to Laser Cutter. <br>
            Features : <br>
            <ul>
                <li>User-friendly</li>
                <li>Compatible with AI, BMP, PLT, DXF, DST</li>
                <li>Basic graphic and text editing and imported data typesetting</li>
                <li> Working process and accuracy setting</li>
                <li>USB or network communication</li>
            </ul>

        </p>
        <p>First of all I created a 2D design in Fusion 360 and then uploaded it as a .dxf file. It is important to convert the drawing file into .dxf file as this format is accepted by Laser Cad. After that I selected the power and speed of laser cutter and modified the dimensions as per the need. I uploaded the file to Laser cutter and adjusted the position of box size on cardboard. Finally I pressed the start button and the machine started to cut the design. After some time the cutting was completed and this is how I obtained my first ever laser cut design.   </p>

            Learning Outcomes: <br>
            1)I am able to understand the working of Laser Cutter. <br>
            2)I am able to cut and engrave designs using Laser Cutter <br>
            3)I am able to use Laser Cad software
